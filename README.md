#Setup instructions
All of this should be done prior to Jan 22. We'll start off the class assuming that you have these things working.

##Get the OS
You'll need either Ubuntu 12.04 or OS X. It's not recommended to use Windows since we won't be able to help you debug if any issues come up.  

###Ubuntu
There are two options, either setting up Ubuntu as a dual boot/primary OS, or running it in a VM. If you don't already have Ubuntu, we recommend setting it up as VM. Follow [these instructions](http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtualbox). When choosing your ubuntu install you will need the desktop-1386 version.

###OS X
* Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
* Install [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)

##Setting up everything else
* Get Chrome. In OS X just get the binary and install it. To do this in Ubuntu, copy the following commands into your terminal, in order:

```
wget -q -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add -;
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list';
sudo apt-get update;
sudo apt-get install google-chrome-stable;
```
* Get node. In OSX get the [nodejs binary](http://nodejs.org/) and install it. In Ubuntu:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js;
sudo apt-get update;
sudo apt-get install nodejs;
sudo apt-get install npm;
```
* Install express by opening up a terminal and typing in ```sudo npm install express -g```
* Get a [Github account](https://github.com/)
* Setup the [public/private github ssh key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys#platform-linux)
* Get a [Heroku account](http://www.heroku.com/)
* Do [steps 1-3](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart) to setup Heroku

##Making sure everything works
If you properly created everything, you should be able to open up a terminal and do the following:

```
git clone git://github.com/olinjs/setup.git setup; cd setup;
npm install;
heroku create;
git push heroku master;
```

If everything works, you should see a message like

```
...
...
...
Launching... done, v4
       http://<some random thing>.herokuapp.com deployed to Heroku
```

If you navigate to http://\<some random thing\>.herokuapp.com you should see "hello world".
